# Corpus of latrinalia

This is a [tsakorpus](https://bitbucket.org/tsakorpus/tsakorpus/src/master/) instance of the [Corpus of latrinalia](https://linghub.ru/wc_corpus/index_en.html), aka *WC Corpus*.

## Tsakorpus

This corpus uses a linguistic corpus search platform called *tsakorpus*. This is a fork of the [tsakorpus repository](https://bitbucket.org/tsakorpus/tsakorpus/src/master/), which contains corpus-specific settings and the source data alongside the generic platform files. For information about installing and using tsakorpus, please refer to the tsakorpus repository.

## Corpus of latrinalia

The multilingual corpus of latrinalia (restroom inscriptions) is a result of an informal collaboration between several people. It contains pictures of inscriptions taken in public restrooms with transcriptions and metadata. The corpus is rather small at the moment, but it is a work in progress. Anyone is welcome to contribute to the corpus. If you'd like to do so, please write to Timofey Arkhangelskiy <timarkh@gmail.com>.

The source files (images, metadata and transcriptions) are located in ``src_convertors/corpus``. You may use them as you wish; however, we would appreciate mentioning the authors and including the link either to this repository or to the web site.
